- The size of the work unit was fixed at 300. The 
  size was determined by checking the real time and CPU time 
  for various input sequences.

- Output of the program for scala project1.scala 1000000 4
  
  No sequence was found in this range

- The ratio of CPU time to real time - 4.714

	real	0m1.400s
	user	0m6.452s
	sys	0m0.216s

- The largest sequence on which the program was tested sucessfully: 5000000 200
